## COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 1 - (ITC111L) 

### I. Introduction
In today’s generation, Innovation is the key in order to survive and prolong the human civilization. Our society has invented many things in terms of technology that benefit human labor and other daily activities. From creating a plan, framework or prototype, all of those will be applied into a system and will help technology improve. As students of the course BS Information Technology, we decided to conduct research on how to create a simple airline ticketing system in order to get a grasp on how a ticketing system works and to think of the ways to improve it in the near future. We suggest this method due to the fact that we want to make the user interaction friendly to all users without assistance.

### II. Description of the Project
An airline ticketing system is a program used to make a ticket or receipt of a flight schedule of a passenger. The purpose of this is to make a flight booking faster and more efficient in a way such that the user will just need to press or input certain values in order to select the flight wanted. This includes the type of trip, destination, date of flight, number of passengers, baggage weight, and the whole receipt. 

### III. Objectives
The main objective of this project is to help passengers book a flight in an efficient way without taking a huge amount of time processing. 
Example: 
1.	To develop a program using C++ that enables to reserve customers their desired dates and destinations in a certain flight.
2.	To utilize advance programming concepts such as structure, use of advanced functions and different loops to implement the system. 

### IV. Significance of the Study
This project will be significant due to the fact that Airline ticketing usually takes a lot of time and causes delayed actions in flights. This program is a way to shorten the time taken and give passengers convenience.  

### V. Scope and Delimitations
The project of the researchers solely focuses only on providing passengers convenience in booking a flight. The user can input a destination and date of flight of their choice which they can print out. It will also provide a receipt containing the price of the said flight.

#### Delimitations of the Study
The study has its own limitations which will be discussed: This study does not cover the choices of private, economy and business class flight. It only has 4 choices in places in which all of them are not international destinations. This program does not include any discounts nor insurance fees. 

### VI.	SCREEN OUTPUT
